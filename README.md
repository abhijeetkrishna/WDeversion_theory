## About <a name = "about"></a>
We analyze the growth patterns in the *Drosophila* wing disc during its transformation from a larva to a pupa. Growth patterns are obtained from processing segmented data from microscopic images. Using a spring lattice, we then verify whether these growth patterns can explain the 3D shape change in the wing disc.

## Folders

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Clone the repository to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.
`git clone git@git.mpi-cbg.de:krishna/wdeversion_theory.git`

## Prerequisites
You need to install [OpenFPM](http://openfpm.mpi-cbg.de/) to run the simulations.
Other packages used are mentioned in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file. You can create a [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment) or just make sure that the packages on your machine are compatible with the packages mentioned in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).
